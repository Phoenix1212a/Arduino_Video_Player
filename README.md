To use the project, you will need:
1x MicroSD card reader module (eg. https://amzn.eu/d/acATj2H)
1x MicroSD card (eg. https://amzn.eu/d/g5IETY9)
1x Arduino Mega (eg. https://amzn.eu/d/iRu1ujk)
2x Buttons (eg. https://amzn.eu/d/3Fp7ODf)
1x 128x64 monochrome oled screen (eg. https://amzn.eu/d/bhu455E)

usage:
First build the project, then take the video you want to watch as .MP4, then use this command ```ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=128:64" -vsync 0 "%08d.png"``` before using the command, you have to move your .mp4 file to the project file, then rename it to "input.mp4". 
After the frames are extracted, use one of the 2 .exe files on the terminal in the direction of the project like this:

If you want filtered result with Floydâ€“Steinberg dithering which makes text harder to read but gives depth perception, use this command on the terminal:
```./png2binFiltered (amount of frames you want to convert) video.bin```
If you want unfiltered result:
```./png2bin (amount of frames you want to convert) video.bin```
after the conversion is done, add video.bin to your SD card's root directory then insert it into the sd card reader and voilla!

Here's how to use the video reader:
press 1st button to stop the video.
press 2nd button to rewind the video 5 seconds.
press both of them at once to forward the video 5 seconds.
Write ```.(desired frame rate)``` to the Arduino IDE serial line to change the frame rate of the video.

This is my first git repository, please do this project while acknowledging it.
